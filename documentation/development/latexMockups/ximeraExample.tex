\section{What's so Special About \textit{e}?}

I remember the number $e$,
\[
e = 2.718281828459045\dots,
\]
being a very mysterious number. Calculus might be able to help explain
why someone might be interested in this number.

\begin{question}
  Find a function $f(x)$ such that
  \[
  f(0) = 1.
  \]
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{hint}
      What functions do you know? Try evaluating them at zero and see
      if you get.
    \end{hint}
    $f(x) = \answer{1}$
  \end{solution}
  How many such functions can you find? What's the simplest function you
  can find?
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{hint}
      There are lots of solutions.
    \end{hint}
    \answer[free-response]{We can find many answers, $f(x)=x$ is one
      such answer.}
  \end{solution}
