### What is Ximera?

Ximera is the interactive textbook platform created through [NSF Grant
DUE-1245433](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1245433).

### What does it do?

A content author uploads classroom activities to GitHub; the Ximera
backend server downloads these activities and presents them to
students.

### Who is Ximera for?

Whether you are an instructor or a student, Ximera has [something to offer you](/about/who).

### Why is it called Ximera?

The X is a capital [chi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_(letter)),
so Ximera is pronounced like
[chimera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)), and a
chimera is a mythical beast composed of three different animals.  Likewise, Ximera glues together LaTeX, JavaScript, and HTML to produce a compelling student experience.

### I am a teacher.  Can I provide material from Ximera to my students?

Yes, absolutely!  Please feel free to use the material you find here
for your own students.  We'd love to [hear about](/about/contact) how
