The Ximera Project (pronounced [chimera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)), with a Greek [chi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_(letter))) is a [free and open-source platform](https://github.com/kisonecat/ximera) for creating and sharing interactive online course materials. The goal of Ximera is to make it easier for authors familiar with [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) to create interactive online content and to provide educators and researchers with quantitative data on student performance and involvement.

Key features of our platform include

* **A content conversion tool and LaTeX document class.** Ximera gives authors the ability to create a *single* LaTeX document that can be compiled as both a [PDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) and an [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_file) file. This allows authors to create course materials that can be used as handouts or as interactive webpages. 

* **Web hosting and content repository.** All online content generated using Ximera will be hosted for free. In doing so, the goal is to encourage the creation of a large community of active authors that can generate and share course materials without the worry of more technical issues.

* **A JavaScript library.** Having created quite a few interactive elements already with  [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), Ximera also acts as a library providing common functionality that can be used to produce virtual manipulatives. Authors can contribute to the library or borrow from it to enhance their own course materials.

* **Modular content.** Ximera gives educators the ability to pick and choose from the course materials available online, allowing for the construction of custom courses.

* **Feedback through data analysis.** Ximera does more than just act as a hosting site for authors and educators, it also has a powerful backend that collects data and analyses how students interact with the content. Educators and researchers can receive feedback from students on a variety of different statistics, from basic mean computations on a set of questions to the amount of time students spend interacting with a particular manipulative. 

### Support Ximera

Building the backend technology, providing the servers, and handling the technical issues for our educators all require the work of many people---all that ultimately means that Ximera depends on you.  If you are interested in partnering with Ximera to provide education technology to the world, please [contact us](/about/contact).

To get involved right away, there are several simple things you can do.

*  Download our LaTeX tools from [GitHub](https://github.com/bartsnapp/ximeraLatex) and use them to write a LaTeX document and try our conversion process.

*  Write JavaScript interactive elements and share them with others.

*  Download our source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/kisonecat/ximera) and contribute to the content conversion tool.
