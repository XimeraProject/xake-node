Ximera allows educators to author their own interactive lessons with
no programming experience. If you can write a LaTeX document, Ximera
empowers you to write an online interactive lesson.  Ximera activities
are easy to author, edit, and, since they are stored on a GitHub
repository, they are ripe for collaboration.

### Activities ###

The basic resource that Ximera provides is an activity. Just as
handouts are often used in traditional classes as single-day activities
for students to explore, a Ximera activity is a focused document on a
few concepts. Ximera allows an educator to make both a traditional
handout and an online activity simultaneously. If you are interested,
pull our authoring tools from our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/bartsnapp/ximeraLatex).

### Courses ###

Courses are built from lists of activities. Educators choose which to
use, and build their courses for their needs. Once an activity is
made, anyone can use it in their courses.

### Collaboration ###

Since Ximera is heavily integrated with GitHub, collaboration for
authors of activities is easy. Moreover, a complete history of the
activity documents is stored, so authors are free to make, and undo,
changes.
