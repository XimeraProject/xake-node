### Special thanks

### History 

In the autumn of 2010, Snapp led a team of computer science undergraduates (Sam Colburn, Gus Coliadis, Will Mohr, and Jhovary Ruiz) in creating a proof-of-concept interactive textbook for the iPad.

In the summer of 2011, Fowler and Snapp worked with a computer science graduate student (Joo-Kyung Kim) on the content navigator.

In the fall of 2011, Fowler and Snapp worked on the content conversion tool, ironing out many problems.

In the spring of 2012, Fowler and Snapp lead a team of computer science graduate students (Shweta Kulkarni, Sai Prathyusha Peddi, Aditi Singhal, and Diego Zaccai) in this project.
