Data turned medicine from anecdotes into science; data has the same
effect on education.  But gathering data is much too expensive!  If
only there were some way to produce activity logs for each student,
without the awkward overhead of moving students into [Bentham's
Panopticon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon).

But there is a way!  Instead of an in-person course, use a massive
open online course (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course"><abbr class="initialism">MOOC</abbr></a>).  Once the student experience is online,
the student experience can be logged, so <abbr class="initialism">MOOC</abbr>s provide tons of free
data on exactly how students are using the educational resources we
provide.  **Online isn't the point: data is the point.**

Big data pays off right away.  Because the courses are massive
(Calculus One had 35k enrollments), there's enough data to see trends.
A wrong answer caused by a misconception in one percent of my students
might go unnoticed when I only teach a couple hundred students, but
when a few hundred <abbr class="initialism">MOOC</abbr> students submit the same wrong answer, we take
notice, and we can program our quizzes to address the misconception
for future students.

Big data also pays off in the long run.  <abbr class="initialism">MOOC</abbr>s are real-time (this is
not the Postal Service) and interactive (this is not watching TV), yet
much of that real-time interactivity arises from (or, at least, is
stored in) a fixed form, namely posts in the forums, the lecture
videos we made, the textbook we wrote, and the exercises (which are
really just computer programs) we designed.  A fixed form makes
iterative development possible.

How so?  When I teach an in-person course for the second time, each
lecture is a new reading from improved notes; when a <abbr class="initialism">MOOC</abbr> runs a
second time, we can re-use the pieces that worked and fix the parts
that didn't.  Data tells us precisely where improvement is needed.

Unfortunately, I often hear that it'll be so much easier to run
Calculus One for the second time, now that I have the videos recorded;
and yes, yes, the second run will be easier in significant ways, but
serious iterative development is seriously expensive enough that I
doubt <abbr class="initialism">MOOC</abbr>s will save money---what <abbr class="initialism">MOOC</abbr>s will save is education.
We'll know exactly which paragraphs students are turning to in the
textbook when they're struggling with a particular homework problem;
we'll know exactly when students pause the lecture; we'll know exactly
which instructors communicate most effectively with students to
improve outcomes.  In ten years time, with that feedback mechanism in
place, the most effective learning experiences will be found online.
