I've just returned from the Coursera Partners conference. This was a
chance for people who are teaching massive open online courses (MOOCs)
and those who are interested in these things to get together and
share/learn/collaborate.  I got to meet up with my old teacher,
friend, and competitor Rob Ghrist.

You see, Jim Fowler, Steve Gubkin, a few others, and I at OSU have been
running a Calculus One MOOC that we call "MOOCulus." Rob Ghrist is
doing something similar at the University of Pennsylvania, though his
MOOC doesn't have a funny little name. Ok, I suppose it
does&mdash;since he is basically teaching out of his beautiful book,
titled "Funny Little Calculus Text."

Despite the fact that we are now technically in direct competition,
since we are both teaching calculus MOOCs, I don’t think we really
view ourselves as competitors&mdash;rather we see each other as vanguards,
cheering at each other’s successes. After talking to the people at the
conference, I think most (if not all) of us honestly see the MOOC
phenomenon as something of a “force of nature” and rather than fight
the current of these murky waters, we choose to learn to surf the
waves.

We face many obstacles on our way. One is that we as academics are
unsure what our roles as teachers would be in a post-MOOC society. I'm
an optimist. I see MOOCs as a way to enhance education. The practice,
rote procedures, and tedium of skills one needs can be pushed off on
to the MOOC. At this point the teacher can get to the good stuff such
as critical thinking and creativity&mdash;things that belong in all
courses including calculus.

Another obstacle we face is that of longevity. Technology changes at
an essentially incomprehensible rate. How do you produce courseware
that will last 5 years? Several solutions were discussed at the
conference, here is what we've adopted:

1. Use formats that are "here to stay" 
2. Produce content as efficiently as possible.  

I’ll address these in turn. To start, formats that are "here to stay"
are those such as the Wiki markup, LaTeX, and basic XML. These are all
markup languages, whose content if needed could be converted (and
enhanced!) to a future format without trouble.

Second, we try to be as efficient as possible when making video
content. Jim Fowler has been a pioneer in this respect, developing the
"AutoCutter" software that reduces time consuming video editing to a
few key strokes.

One thing is certain to me&mdash;MOOCs are the future. I am encouraged that
with courses like MOOCulus OSU is at the forefront of this revolution.
