Today was the final day of the Ximera Workshop 1. While three days is
not much time, I am very impressed with how much we have
achieved. Thank you so much to everyone involved, and thanks again to
the NSF and the Shuttleworth Foundation for making this possible.

With impassioned discussion, we laid the ground work for the future
of Ximera. This is not to say that we didn't achieve much now, quite
the contrary: Randy Pirum prototype a Ximera Data Viewer, Chris
Cunningham showed an Ximera activity that could identify units, and
give constructive feedback to the students, and Chris Hill explored
the creation of Ximera involving English language questions.

I cannot express how excited I am to see how others use this
platform. It is my hope that we can provide tools that allow content
authors to unleash their own creativity, and build something that has
never before been seen.
