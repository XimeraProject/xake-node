Today was the second day of the Ximera Workshop 1. On the first day,
we spent much time explaining what is going on, and learning that we
need to make some changes. Today we started making these changes!

The nature of Ximera syntax was on the line. Honestly, I was a bit
skeptical at first, but the participants were able to convince me that
our past syntax is inferior to the syntax we are now working to
provide. We improved deployment, and started writing many
activities. To see these demo courses, see
[http://ximera.osu.edu/course/](http://example.net/).


I am very encouraged at the speed of creation of these basic
courses. At this point, we've made it a priority to get documentation
on how someone gets started with Ximera, something that is difficult
since in this early stage of development we are aiming for a moving
target. Nevertheless, I am encouraged by the energy of the workshop,
and hope to see some great things! Again, this would not have been
possible without the support of the NSF and the Shuttleworth
Foundation.
