I'm pleased to announce that I've received a Shuttleworth Flash Grant!
This grant is given to help burgeoning ideas come to life. We are
excited to use this to help support the Ximera project.

<!--more-->

Our current thought is that these funds will be best used to help
build a community of developers and authors who work with Ximera.

While content in mathematics might seem like a slow-moving target, the
fact is that quality content is produced through iterative
development. When others can develop content and contribute to content
that is already deployed, we (as a community) are able to produce
superior materials that will have relevance despite the ephemeral
nature of the internet.

Our first workshop is July 28th to the 30th. I'm looking forward to
it!
